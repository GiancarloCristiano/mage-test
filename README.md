>## Notes:
> 1. The tickets id are only for example.
> 2. The file composer.json is needed to install the Mageplaza Slider module by setup:upgrade.
> 3. Once it is installed, just follow this steps:
    - Go to **Content > Banner Sliders > Manage Banners** and create 3 with the images in
    *pub/media/mageplaza/bannerslider/banner/...*
    - Then in **Manage Sliders** create one positioned in **Home Page** > *Top of content*.
    - After that, add the three banners to this slider.
    - Finally in **Configuration**, we can set some features, for example *Show Next/Prev buttons*.
> 4. The CMS image selection was because it represents my analytical (developer) and my creative (designer) professions
> 5. The most important: thank you very much. Happy coding!
